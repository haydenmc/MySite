description: I started a fan website for a real-time strategy game called Machines that I still run today.

In 1999 a new 3D strategy game was released for PC called
[Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machines_(video_game)).

The game featured a unique mix of top-down real-time strategy and first person
combat by allowing you to take control and pilot any of the units under your
command.

Here's the intro video from the game:

Though it didn't amass as much of an audience as its RTS contemporaries, a small
but dedicated following emerged on the internet.

I set up a forum called [WiredForWar.org](https://wiredforwar.org) that hosted
discussions spanning multiple decades about the game and efforts to preserve,
modify, and recreate it.

Here's what the forum looked like in June of 2007:

The forum was established around 2002 and ran on
[phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/), but a few years later switched to
[Simple Machines Forum](https://www.simplemachines.org/). Circa 2013 the old 
forum was shut down and archived and a new instance of
[NodeBB](https://nodebb.org/) took its place.

I still maintain the site today; it serves as a searchable entrypoint to
Machines resources, but most conversations have moved to the
[WiredForWar Discord](https://discord.gg/J6e9MsY).

Notably, in 2020, the source code to Machines was uncovered, and the rights to
the game were acquired by Night Dive Studios. The source was released under an
open source license and can be found
[on GitHub](https://github.com/markol/machines).

Here's what the forum looks like as of 2024:
