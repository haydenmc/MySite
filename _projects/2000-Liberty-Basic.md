At ~9 years old I had the first real programming experience I can remember
with a tool called Liberty Basic.

As I'm sure is common, video games provided fuel to my passion for computing,
and I desperately wanted to understand how I could make my own.

I asked some adults who told me BASIC was a great way to learn how to program.
So I went in search of a way to write my own BASIC programs.

A web search led me to a tool called
[Liberty Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_BASIC).

Liberty Basic provided an easy way to write BASIC on Windows. It had a simple
IDE, extensive documentation, and plenty of examples to learn from.

I was quickly writing my own "guess the number" games and choose-your-own
adventures.

I eventually discovered other tools like The Games Factory and
[Game Maker]({% link _projects/2003-Game-Maker-Games.md %}), which made writing
games a lot easier.
