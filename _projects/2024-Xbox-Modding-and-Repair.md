The original Xbox has been and remains my favorite console of all-time.

In elementary school I bought a used one from my Dad's coworker because I
_really_ wanted to play Halo after being introduced to it by a friend.

A little while later, [Kevin Rose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rose)
showed up on [TechTV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechTV) and taught me that
they could be modded and made to run custom software. Amazingly, I was able to
find the actual segment on YouTube.

Inspired, I went on the internet, ordered myself an Xecuter 3 modchip, and
struggled for multiple days to solder it in place before finally seeing the X3
BIOS show up and feeling total relief and elation that I didn't completely
destroy my Xbox.

Here it is after years of neglect, somehow still working despite the horrendous
solder job:

# Xbox Resurgence

A little after 2020, the original Xbox saw a resurgence in community activity.

New mods were released to
[add an HDMI port](https://makemhz.com/products/stellar-xboxhd-standalone),
[allow huge hard drive sizes above 2TB](https://github.com/gaasedelen/titan),
[play Xbox Live again](https://insignia.live/), and more.

I decided to grab myself a fresh Xbox off of eBay and set it up with the latest
and greatest offered by the community.

# Assembling My Own Mod Chips

For some reason I also decided that this was a great opportunity to improve my
soldering skills. So instead of ordering a pre-assembled modchip, I ordered some
unpopulated PCBs and components to assemble the open-source
[OpenXenium](https://github.com/Xbox-Preservation-Project/OpenXenium) mod chip
myself.

After some hours of tiny component soldering I had myself a few fully assembled
OpenXenium mod chips!

# More Xboxes

With a handful of mod chips in my possession, I decided the next logical step
was to make use of them (and continue improving my soldering/electronics skills)
by buying the cheapest broken Xboxes I could find on eBay, repairing them, and
installing the mod chips.

I was able to find a bunch of Xboxes at around $20 each. Some had issues with
blown capacitors or loose connections between the hard disk, but I was able to
get every one of them booting and working properly.

After repairing and modding 4 more Xboxes, my soldering skills significantly
improved. And now I can give away some cool Xboxes to friends and loved ones!
