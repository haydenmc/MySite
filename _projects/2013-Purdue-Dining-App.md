description: To help me better learn how to write mobile apps I quickly authored and published a Windows Phone app to view the Purdue University dining hall menus.

The Purdue Dining App for Windows Phone was a quick application I wrote and
published on the Windows Phone Store that allowed users to quickly look up
Purdue University Dining Court hours and menus.

It was the first application I published to any app store, and it helped me
learn how to build an app that adhered to the operating system's UI visuals
and interaction patterns.
