I'm friends with a bunch of nerds, and we choose some unusual services to keep
in touch.

For chatting, I run a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) server. It's similar to
private offerings from Slack and Discord, but is entirely federated and
end-to-end encrypted.

I wrote a bot named Theorem that hangs out in our Matrix server and does some
helpful things:

 - Periodically posts the latest movies that are showing in nearby theaters
 - Periodically posts upcoming volunteering events happening in nearby cities
 - Posts a notification when folks are chatting in our voice server
 - Posts a notification when folks are streaming video to our
   [private streaming server]({% link _projects/2024-EzStream.md %})

The source code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/haydenmc/TheoremChatBot).
