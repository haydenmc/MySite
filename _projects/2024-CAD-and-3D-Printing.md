A very kind friend hooked me up with an Ender 3 v2 3D printer that he found
listed for free on Facebook Marketplace. After printing a few models I found
online, I quickly decided to learn how to design my own using CAD software.

I decided to learn FreeCAD, since I have a preference for open-source tools.
Though it's not quite fully mature yet, it works well enough for a beginner like
myself, and is beginning to pick up some momentum in the CAD community.

A few examples of models I've made are below.

# Soil Moisture Sensor Enclosure

I designed a soil sensor moisture enclosure and waterproofed it by applying some
silicone to the openings.

# Wiimote Holder

I fashioned a little holder for my Wii Remotes! It's
[available on Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/863521-stand-for-4-wii-remote-wiimotes-and-wrist-straps).

# Wii Sensor Bar Holder

I made a little device that holds the Wii sensor bar underneath my TV.

# Wi-Fi QR Code Card

I made a little physical QR code card for folks to join my home's guest Wi-Fi.

# Record Album Holder

Here's a model that holds my records in a semi-staggered display.

# Robot Vacuum Dock Holder

My robot vacuum would occasionally push around its charger when it tried to dock
with it. I designed a part to mount it to the wall and hold it in place.
