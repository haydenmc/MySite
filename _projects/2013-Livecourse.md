During Sophomore year of college I worked with a group of fellow students to
complete a software engineering class project. We decided to build a web app
to allow students to collaborate, chat, and share materials with others who were
enrolled in their classes.

In addition to the web app, we also wrote a native Android client and native
Windows Phone client. Sadly, I can't find any screenshots of the Android app.

The web app was written in the standard LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

The source is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/LiveCourse/LiveCourse).
