Roomie was my first foray into the world of single-page web-apps. It was also my
first time experimenting with the Microsoft web-stack (ASP.Net, TypeScript, etc.)

The goal was to create a portal room mates could use to communicate with each other
and manage things like expenses, groceries, schedule, etc.
