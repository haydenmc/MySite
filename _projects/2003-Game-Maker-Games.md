Around 5th grade or so, after a few years of messing with tools like
[Liberty Basic]({% link _projects/2000-Liberty-Basic.md %}) and "The Games
Factory", I discovered Game Maker.

Game Maker had all the tools you needed to craft fairly sophisticated 2D games.
In addition to tools for creating and managing assets like sprites, tile maps,
and sounds, it also provided a simple scripting language called GML that allowed
you to write intricate logic to run your game. Instead of writing code, GML
could also be generated using a simple drag-and-drop interface.

If you wanted to get really advanced, Game Maker even had an interface to allow
you to import DLLs and call out to native code.

I used Game Maker for the next several years to create dozens of projects, most
of them unfinished. Though I didn't posess much skill in art or game design, the
experience taught me a lot about programming, and even provided me a good excuse
to venture into more advanced concepts like networking.

Here are some examples on some of the more notable projects.

# Tank Shooter

The first game I remember making in Game Maker, a fairly simple shoot-em-up
game using assets and code from some examples I found. And a shamelessly stolen
Halo soundtrack MIDI.

# Defend The City

I was always a fan of missile command, and its DOS cousin [Rocket Raid](https://archive.org/details/RocketRaidMSDOS)

"Defend The City" was a spin on the formula that allowed you to fortify your
defenses with shields and automated gun turrets.
