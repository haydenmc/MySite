Krypton Construct was a mod for
[Tribes 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribes_2), a multiplayer team-based
first person shooter game released in 2001.

In addition to truly awesome gameplay and groundbreaking connectivity
features, the game was also incredibly extensible, giving players free access
to the scripting language and map editing tools used to craft gameplay on top of
the game's engine.

A sizeable community of modders and scripters grew around the game along with
a diverse set of tools and mods, many offering substantially different gameplay
than the base game offered. Modders would share their creations with one
another, along with tips, tutorials, and tools.

In addition to empowering me to create my own Tribes 2 mods, the community also
provided me with resources to learn basic programming in a fun and rewarding
setting.

# Construction Mods

Many mods added the ability for players to summon and manipulate in-game
objects. Creative players were able to use these features to create interesting
structures and mechanisms. Eventually, mods began to focus more on creative
gameplay, and an entire category of Construction Mods emerged.

With fairly advanced tools and a strong community, these mods provided the
same type of creative experience that games like Garry's Mod, Minecraft, and
Roblox would popularize years later.

After playing many flavors of Construction Mod and thinking up a bunch of
features I wanted for myself, I decided to write my own Construction Mod and
called it "**Krypton Construct**".

Krypton had a bunch of cool features - some original, and others inspired by
other popular mods.

## Notable Features

 - A personal save system, allowing players to persist their creations across
   play sessions.
 - Permission spheres that would prevent others from building or fighting in
   your area unless they were added to a list.
 - A combat system that allowed players to opt-in to combat or stick to creative
   gameplay only.
 - A bot that sat in the server and provided automated help to players and
   delivered warnings to those behaving inappropriately.
 - Tools that allowed translation, rotation, and scaling of pieces by simply
   clicking and dragging.
 - Proximity sensors that allowed players to trigger behaviors when a player
   enters the set range.

I made the source code for Krypton Construct available on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/haydenmc/Krypton).

The engine powering Tribes 2 evolved into the
[Torque Game Engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque_(game_engine)) and was
eventually made available to game developers under a paid license. Years later
the engine was 
[open sourced](https://github.com/TorqueGameEngines/Torque3D) and provided to
all users for free.
