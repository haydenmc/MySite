Tribes 2 was a multiplayer team-based first person shooter game released in
2001.

In addition to truly awesome gameplay and groundbreaking connectivity
features, the game was also incredibly extensible, giving players free access
to the scripting language and map editor tools used to craft gameplay on top of
the game's engine.

A sizeable community of modders and scripters grew around the game along with
a diverse set of tools and mods, many offering substantially different gameplay
than the base game offered.

One such mod was called Construction Mod. This mod provided players with in-game
tools that could be used to create custom structures and experiences, offering
the same type of creative play that games like Minecraft would specialize in
years later.

Many flavors of Construction Mod were available in the game's heyday, offering
different sets of unique features. I decided to write my own and called it
"Krypton Construct".

Krypton had a bunch of cool features - some original, and others inspired by
other popular mods.

## Notable Features

 - A personal save system, allowing players to persist their creations across
   play sessions.
 - Permission spheres that would prevent others from building or fighting in
   your area unless they were added to a list.
 - A combat system that allowed players to opt-in to combat or stick to creative
   gameplay only.
 - A bot that sat in the server and provided automated help to players and
   delivered warnings to those behaving inappropriately.
 - Tools that allowed translation, rotation, and scaling of pieces by simply
   clicking and dragging.
 - Proximity sensors that allowed players to trigger behaviors when a player
   enters the set range.

I made the source code for Krypton Construct available on GitHub
[here](https://github.com/haydenmc/Krypton).

The engine powering Tribes 2 evolved into the Torque Game Engine and was
eventually made available to game developers under a paid license. Years later
the engine was 
[open sourced](https://github.com/TorqueGameEngines/Torque3D) and provided to
all users for free.
