FlashCom is a piece of software I wrote to help me quickly run commands or
launch applications.

The idea is that you set up FlashCom with a tree of commands you want quick
access to, with each node of the tree assigned to a particular keyboard key.

Whenever you'd like to run something, simply invoke FlashCom by pressing
Win+Space, then press the key strokes to navigate the tree and launch the
desired command.

The source code along with instructions on how to use FlashCom is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/haydenmc/FlashCom).

You can download FlashCom from the
[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9P46ZB80RWL8), or from the
GitHub [releases page](https://github.com/haydenmc/FlashCom/releases).
