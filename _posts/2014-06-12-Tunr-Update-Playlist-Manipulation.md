Life's busy with my job ramping up, and summer classes. But **TUNR**.

I've added some simple playlist manipulation controls that pop up on top of the playlist item that you select. It's a simple approach, but it works for both touch and mouse/keyboard without any sort of separate interaction model. This implementation isn't very polished yet, and will probably receive a lot more work. But the basic functionality is there.

I've also added a simple play timer in the bottom right corner of the Now Playing pane. The Now Playing pane will eventually be used to creatively showcase information / art about the songs you're currently listening to. 

The tilt effect has also been refined - items that tilt will now animate back to their 'flattened' state after they've been released. They also press 'into' the page rather than just tilt, so it's a bit more physical looking. 

The log in has been refined a bit, changing up the motion of the button and adding an indeterminate indicator. The tilt effect was also applied to the button.

**I'll probably start opening this up to pre-pre-pre-alpha testing soon.** Do you have your own music library? Want to try this out? Tweet at me or send me a mail!
