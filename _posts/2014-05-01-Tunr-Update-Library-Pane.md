I've been working **a lot** on Tunr, and it's going quite well. On the back-end, Tunr can now accept uploaded music, track the meta data, and store the file in the Azure cloud. On the front-end, I've started working on the library browser. Here's a quick demo video!

Performance is a huge priority. The data for your entire library is actually streamed to the browser when you first log in, so there will be minimal delays while browsing your music.
