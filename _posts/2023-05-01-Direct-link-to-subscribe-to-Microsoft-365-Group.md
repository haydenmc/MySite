[Microsoft 365 Groups](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/learn-about-microsoft-365-groups-b565caa1-5c40-40ef-9915-60fdb2d97fa2)
(formerly known as Outlook Groups as far as I can remember) are an easy way to
set up a shared collaboration space with a group of colleagues. Creating a
group provides you with a mailing list, shared calendar, and SharePoint space
for documents.

One feature I found missing, however, was a way to share a link for folks to use
to join your group!

Though it's missing in Outlook as far as I can tell, there's a URL that allows
you to achieve this:

```
https://outlook.office.com/owa/YOURGROUPHERE@groups.yourcompany.com/groupsubscription.ashx?action=join
```

Just fill in your group's name and folks who click the link will be prompted
to join.
