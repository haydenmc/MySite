When Windows 10X was put to rest, our team was repurposed to help with new gaming features
for Windows 11!

As a PC gamer, this was great news to me!

# Controller Bar

Over the course of about a year, I worked to architect, code, and ship the feature known as
[Controller Bar](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/05/05/windows-insiders-can-now-try-out-an-early-preview-of-controller-bar/).

Controller Bar provides gaming users with quick access to their controller-friendly games
without having to fuss around with a keyboard or mouse.

One tap of the "Nexus button" on the Xbox controller opens Controller Bar. From there,
you can select from one of your most recently-played games, or a set of gaming-related
software (like Steam, Xbox, etc.)

You can also navigate from Controller Bar to the
[Game Bar](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/xbox-game-bar/9NZKPSTSNW4P)
by selecting the "home" icon. Game Bar is an existing experience that provides access
to a set of gaming-related utilities while you're playing your games.
