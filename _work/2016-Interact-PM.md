After my first role as a [Program Manager on Windows Personalization]({% link _work/2015-Personalization-PM.md %}),
I decided I wanted to spend more of my time on the actual activities involved with building
software rather than managing the PM duties. Through some connections with my wonderful colleagues
inside of the Windows Shell team, I was able to find a role in an incubation team called
Windows Interact Next. Here I would still act as a PM, but be involved in the process of
hacking together prototypes to validate various nascent interaction patterns. This struck a 
great balance for me!

On Interact Next we built prototypes for all sorts of wild human-computer-interaction mediums.
Though I can't discuss many of them in detail, some of them would go on to ship as real products.

# Notable Products

## Surface Dial

The team created prototypes exploring physical objects being detected when placed on-screen,
and different ways users could interact with Windows and applications through manipulation of
physical objects.

This project ultimately fed into Surface Dial with Windows Shell integration and
[APIs for application developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/input/windows-wheel-interactions){:target="_blank"}
to harness Dial interactions.

## Surface Duo / Surface Neo

The team incubated on concepts relating to multi-screen mobile devices - these prototypes
would eventually feed into the productization of Surface Duo and Surface Neo, which I ended
up [working on as a Software Engineer]({% link _work/2017-Devices-SWE.md %}).
